### Firebase Authentication & Firestore Watchlist

- **User Authentication**: Added full support for user sign-up, login, and logout using Firebase Authentication. The app now features dedicated Login and Signup pages, and the navigation bar updates based on authentication state.
- **Persistent Watchlist**: The watchlist is now stored in Firestore for authenticated users, allowing favorites to sync across devices. For guests, the watchlist is stored in localStorage.
- **Context-Driven State**: Implemented modular React Contexts for both authentication and watchlist management, ensuring clean, maintainable, and scalable state management.
- **UI/UX Consistency**: The watchlist UI matches the homepage for a seamless user experience. Users can add/remove coins to their watchlist from the coin detail page with a single click.
